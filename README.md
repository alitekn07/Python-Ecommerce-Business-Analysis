# 📊 Python E-Commerce Data Analysis – Sales, Product & Customer Insights

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive **end-to-end Python data analysis portfolio project** built using a real-world e-commerce dataset.

The objective is to analyze:

- Business performance  
- Customer behavior  
- Product performance  
- Revenue concentration  
- Price distribution  
- RFM-based customer segmentation  

The project simulates a real-world **Data Analyst workflow**, including data cleaning, transformation, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, visualization, and business insight generation.

**Dataset period:**  
September 2016 – October 2018

## 🎯 Business Objectives

- Evaluate overall revenue performance  
- Analyze order volume trends  
- Identify top-performing product categories  
- Measure revenue concentration (Pareto Analysis)  
- Examine customer behavior patterns  
- Segment customers using RFM methodology  
- Detect high-value, loyal, and at-risk customers  

## Dataset Description

**Source:** Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist (Kaggle)

Main datasets used:

- `olist_orders_dataset.csv`
- `olist_order_items_dataset.csv`
- `olist_products_dataset.csv`
- `olist_customers_dataset.csv`
- `product_category_name_translation.csv`

Only **delivered orders** were included to reflect completed transactions.

Data preparation included:

- Merging relational tables  
- Handling date-time columns  
- Feature engineering (revenue calculation)  
- Cleaning missing values  
- Filtering relevant business metrics  

## Data Preparation & Engineering

The project follows a structured data preparation process:

- Table joins using Pandas  
- Revenue calculation per order item  
- Datetime conversion & Recency calculation  
- Customer-level aggregation  
- Category-level performance aggregation  
- Product-level revenue ranking  

Key engineered features:

- `revenue`
- `order_count`
- `avg_price`
- `recency`
- `frequency`
- `monetary`

## Analysis Structure

### 1. Business Overview
- Monthly Revenue Trend  
- Revenue Contribution by Category  
- Pareto Revenue Distribution  

### 2. Customer Analysis
- Customer Order Frequency Distribution  
- Revenue by Customer Type (One-Time vs Repeat)  
- Customer Revenue Pareto Curve  
- Average Order Value Comparison  

### 3. Product Analysis
- Top 10 Categories by Revenue  
- Revenue vs Order Volume Comparison  
- Revenue per Order by Category  
- Product-Level Revenue Concentration (Top 10 / Top 50)  
- Price Distribution Analysis  
- Average Price by Category  
- Price vs Revenue Relationship (Correlation & Scatter Analysis)  

### 4. RFM Segmentation
- Recency Calculation  
- Frequency Calculation  
- Monetary Value Calculation  
- RFM Scoring  
- Customer Segment Classification  
- Identification of:
  - Champions  
  - Loyal Customers  
  - Potential Loyalists  
  - At Risk  
  - Lost Customers

## 📊 Outputs

The project provides:

- Executive-level business insights  
- Customer behavior analysis  
- Revenue concentration findings  
- Product-level performance breakdown  
- RFM-based segmentation strategy  

All visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- RFM Modeling  

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Revenue shows consistent growth across the analyzed period.  
- A small number of categories contribute disproportionately to total revenue (Pareto effect).  
- Revenue concentration at the product level is relatively distributed (low top 10 dominance).  
- The majority of customers are one-time buyers, indicating retention opportunity.  
- High-value customers can be clearly identified using RFM scoring.  
- Average price and total revenue show weak correlation at category level, indicating volume-driven revenue in many segments.  

## 🎤 Summary

This project demonstrates a complete analytical workflow using Python, from raw data processing to business-level insight generation.

It highlights practical data analysis skills including:

- Data wrangling  
- Aggregation & feature engineering  
- Visualization  
- Revenue analysis  
- Customer segmentation  

The project simulates a real-world Data Analyst scenario and focuses on translating raw data into meaningful business decisions.
